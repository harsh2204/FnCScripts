#Fun & Convenient Scripts
---
This just a collection of 'scripts' I've written that were fun small side-projects or convenient code for myself. The scripts range from file manipulation to easy to use scrappers. I would high recommend to read the readme.md or the comments in the code before using it because they are tailored for very specific purposes. Enjoy the 'scripts'

<sub>I write scripts in quotes because I personally do not consider some of them to be REAL scripts.</sub>
